<div style="text-align: justify">
Working as an Embedded Software Engineer sometimes involves integrating an interface for establishing interaction with the users, it could be a display, buttons, even a web interface or a Mobile app, this time I was involved in a cold chain project where I have to send data to a server in order to create records of a temperature product, demonstrating to a client that the product is in good conditions according to temperature measures registered in the system.

## The team

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I was with a UI designer and another Embedded Software Engineer who also develop this app. The solution consisted of a mobile app with Android and a Raspberry Pi for extracting data from temperature dataloggers through USB.

## Challenges

<div style="text-align: justify">
I've never tried to develop a mobile app but working in a startup gives me the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and also learn a lot. In this project the challenges were:
</div>

- Create a Mobile App.
- Connect the app with a Datalogger.
- Extract the data.
- Create an interface satisfying the designer's requirements.
- Successfully send the data to the server.

## Tasks

<div style="text-align: justify">
The App was focused to do two things: registering dataloggers through bar code, extracting the data from the dataloggers, and sending the data to the server. The first iteration of this development was with a barcode scanner, USB Temperature Dataloggers, and a Rasberry Pi for extracting the data and communicating with the app through Bluetooth. Knowing this my tasks in this project were:
</div>

- Develop a Mobile App using Flutter.
- Create interfaces satisfying the UI designer's requirements.
- Connect the App with the Raspberry Pi through Bluetooth.
- Parse the data from a pdf file, just get the temperature measurements and times.
- Extract the barcode of the Datalogger.
- Send the data to the server.


## Results

<div style="text-align: justify">
The project accomplished all the requirements since extracting the barcode and sending the data to the server. Some of the most important features were:
</div>

- A thorough Mobile App result.


## Next steps
