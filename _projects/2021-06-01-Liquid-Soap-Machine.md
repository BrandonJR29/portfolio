After some experience developing projects such as IoT products, embedded systems, and control systems under the supervision of a senior engineer and with the support of other Embedded Software Engineers. One opportunity showed up and at that time I was on my own, therefore I must design the embedded software solution from the beginning, the test cases, developing a good-performance final product, and achieve all the client requirements. The Liquid Soap Vending Machine was one of the best experiences I've ever had, working with people that I didn't know and being in charge of one of the most important parts of the project.

## The team

In this project, I worked as a contractor with the Embedded Software Engineer role where the client established the machine requirements and our communication with them was by the product owner. The group was conformed of a Fullstack Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Hardware Designer, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and myself. The strategy was developed by the product owner and the scrum master: a meeting via video call twice a week for planning, watching the results, and determining the next steps, and once a week we made tests in the machine with the hardware. Furthermore, we use Jira Software as a task scheduler and also measure the development of the project.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
