My experience in the University was great, I realized that I would be an Embedded Software Engineer when I was doing my final assessment that was designed an implement a Fuzzy Logic Controller for a Ball and Beam System. This time I used all the knowledge that I got in the classrom such as physics, math, programming, and control theory for finally built a controller with an awesome performance.

## Challenges

This was my first control system, so I was so excited to give my best on it, the challenges that I found were:

- Designed a Fuzzy Logic Controller in MATLAB with Simulink.
- Designed a Fuzzy Logic Controller with three inputs.
- Designed a PD Controller.
- Optimized the Fuzzy Logic Controller.
- Adjust the signals of the system.
- Create the control hardware.
- Implement the controllers.

## Tasks

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project I found a variety of taks such as choose the microcontroller, study the system, make the hardware, designed the controllers, and implement the controllers. I couldn't say that it wasn't interesting, believe me if you really love control systems this is the best way to start. As you can see this tasks infers another nested tasks, I can summarize them in the next items:
</div>

- Extract the interested variables of the systems, in this case were the ball position and the beam angle.
- Designed the hardware filters for signals adjustments to the microcontroller.
- Designed and simulate the controllers obtaining a good-performance from them.
- Development of the firmware in C/C++ with FreeRTOS.
- Test the system with different set points.
- Compare the result with the simulation through UART connection with MATLAB generating plots.
