    <p>After some experience developing projects such as IoT products, embedded systems, and control systems under the supervision of a senior engineer and with the support of other Embedded Software Engineers. One opportunity showed up and at that time I was on my own, therefore I must design the embedded software solution from the beginning, the test cases, developing a good-performance final product, and achieve all the client requirements. The Liquid Soap Vending Machine was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had, working with people that I didn’t know and being in charge of one of the most important parts of the project.</p>

<h2 id="the-team">The team</h2>

<p>In this project, I worked as a contractor with the Embedded Software Engineer role where the client established the machine requirements and our communication with them was by the product owner. The group was conformed of a Fullstack Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Hardware Designer, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and myself. The strategy was developed by the product owner and the scrum master: a meeting via video call twice a week for planning, watching the results, and determining the next steps, and once a week we made tests in the machine with the hardware. Furthermore, we use Jira Software as a task scheduler and also measure the development of the project.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
