My experience at the University was great, I realized that I would be an Embedded Software Engineer when I was doing my final assessment that was designed and implemented a Fuzzy Logic Controller for a Ball and Beam System. This time I used all the knowledge that I got in the classroom such as physics, math, programming, and control theory to finally built a controller with excellent performance.

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>This was my first control system, so I was so excited to give my best on it, the challenges that I found were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designed a Fuzzy Logic Controller in MATLAB with Simulink.</li>
  <li>Designed a Fuzzy Logic Controller with three inputs.</li>
  <li>Designed a PD Controller.</li>
  <li>Optimized the Fuzzy Logic Controller.</li>
  <li>Adjust the signals of the system.</li>
  <li>Create the control hardware.</li>
  <li>Implement the controllers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I found a variety of tasks such as choosing the microcontroller, studying the system, making the hardware, and designing and implementing the controllers. I couldn't say that it wasn't interesting, believe me if you really love control systems this is the best way to start. As you can see these tasks infer other ones, I can summarize them in the next items:
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Extract the interested variables of the systems, in this case, the ball position and the beam angle.</li>
  <li>Designed the hardware filters for signal adjustments to the microcontroller.</li>
  <li>Designed and simulate the controller obtaining good performance from them.</li>
  <li>Development of the firmware in C/C++ with FreeRTOS.</li>
  <li>Test the system with different set points.</li>
  <li>Compare the result with the simulation through UART connection with MATLAB generating plots.</li>
</ul>

<p>The test videos are in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Vu6w_IInE&amp;list=PL-Z_5Zx_UY59NFn0tXmD-8x4Mgz_DTYgh">link</a></p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>I think the next steps for this project could be about implementing more control techniques, here I implemented two, maybe studying one more It could be found one with a better performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Implementing a thorough control system is a big challenge and also obtained relation between the simulation and the real values in the implementation, for me the lessons of this project were:
</div>

<ul>
  <li>How to integrate the variables in a control system.</li>
  <li>How to implement a control theory strategy in a control system.</li>
  <li>Hardware filters help any controller.</li>
  <li>Optimizing tasks could take time but that time show me that it wasn’t easy even for a computer.</li>
  <li>The simulation and the implementation have to go through some conditioning in order to make it similars.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify">
I feel so good due to I have implemented these controllers they show me bunch of things that I wouldn't forget.  If you are reading this because you love control theory I invite you to read the document of this project on my Github account and also check the code, just remember I did it when I was a junior developer, now I would change a lot of things, starting for the Fuzzy Logic library that use a lot the heap memory. Thanks for reading!
