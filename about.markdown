In this section, I would like to tell you about myself without telling you about what I did as Embedded Software Engineer, so the intention is to tell who I'm outside the keyboar. My name is Brandon I live in Caracas Venezuela and one of the things that I really love is hiking just check out this beautiful picture of a mountain that we have here.

I consider myself an athletic person I really like to do outdoor activities and be in touch with the green areas for that reason I usually go hiking as you can see again in this other picture.

Another thing that I love to do is think about how to solve problems in a creative way and also look at new technological solutions that are being applied nowadays, I know that I said I wouldn't say anything about technology but I think for that reason I'm an Engineer because I really enjoy thinking about that.
